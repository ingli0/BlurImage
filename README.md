## Features
- Capture images from a camera or open stored color or grayscale images
- Create or add methods to select regions using a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Parametric selection of the blurring algorithm and degree of blurring.
- Apply the selected blur effect to the image.
- Save the modified image with the blurred regions at the same resolution or a user-selected resolution.

## Requirements
- Programming Language: python
- Image Processing Library: OpenCV

 2. Install OpenCV library. Refer to the official OpenCV documentation for installation instructions specific to your platform.

## Usage

1. Use the GUI to open an image from a camera or stored file.
2. Select the regions of the image to be blurred using the provided methods.
3. Adjust the blur algorithm and degree of blurring as desired.
4. Apply the blur effect to the image.
5. Save the modified image with the blurred regions.
